# Splitter Android App
Author: CauÃª Garcia Polimanti

This repo is a part of a Graduation Project of my graduation in Analysis and Systems Development at FATEC Ipiranga. 

This project is composed by this Android application and a REST API ([Splitter API](https://github.com/CaueP/SplitterAPI)). The Android application provides checking in on bar and restaurants, making order of products, splitting the bill between people sitting on a same table, and paying the bill using credit card.

The app applies the following technologies:
- FirebaseAuth
- Gson
- Glide
- QRCode Reader and Generator (ZXing)
- Retrofit 2
- RecyclerView
- Cardviews
- "One activity, multiple views" concept
